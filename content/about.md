blueDog Consulting is a boutique DevRel & DevEx consulting firm that specializes in helping businesses and organizations achieve their goals through strategic planning, marketing, and operations improvement. There is no one-size-fits-all solution to achieve success in your Developer Relations and Developer Experience efforts, and so I take the time to understand each client's specific needs and goals, and develop customized solutions that are tailored to their unique situation.

I have spent almost half of my career in DevRel, DevEx, and Community, and have a deep understanding of the tech industry. I am passionate about helping businesses and organizations achieve their goals, and I am commited to delivering high-quality results that exceed your expectations. 

Let me know how I can best help you and your organization. I am always happy to discuss your needs and goals, and to help you develop a customized plan to achieve success.
